<p>Elise MacGill was the first woman world wide to earn a Aeronautical engineering degree. 
 She also was the first woman to design an aircraft. 
 This was an important achievement because it led to her helping mass producing fighter planes. 
 She entered the University of British Columbiaâ€™s applied science program when she was 16, though she was asked to leave. 
 She also was one of the leaders in the Women's rights movement. 
 The coolest part is that she did this while fighting Polio as she contracted the disease in May of 1929.
 She also was the Chief Aeronautical Engineer at Canadian Car and Foundry. 
 This is important because there had never been a woman in that position before that point. 

 <p>She is my hero because she contributed to the world of Aeronautical engineering.
 She allowed me to be able to get my aerospace engineering degree by setting the standard.
 She also helped the allies win World War II even though she could not fight herself.
 All by herself she expanded the number of people building aircrafts in one factory from 500 to 4500. 
 She also stood up for herself when she started becoming an engineer. By the time she graduated she was respected.
